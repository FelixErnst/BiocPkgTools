Description: Bioconductor has a rich ecosystem of metadata around
  packages, usage, and build status. This package is a simple
  collection of functions to access that metadata from R. The goal
  is to expose metadata for data mining and value-added functionality
  such as package searching, text mining, and analytics on
  packages.
