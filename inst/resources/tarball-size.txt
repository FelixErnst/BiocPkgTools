Dear %s (%s),

I am contacting you concerning the '%s' package, on the %s
branch of Bioconductor, for which you are listed as the maintainer.

The size of your package's tarball very much exceeds the normal recommended
limit. Please reduce the size of your package's tarball to about *5 Megabytes*.

See the 'build' section at:
https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/%s/bioc-LATEST/%s/

Thank you for your cooperation in following Bioconductor guidelines.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
